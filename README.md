# BandwagonHost DC99 Limited VPS: $34.5/Year with CN2 GIA Routes

Looking for a budget VPS with solid connectivity to China? BandwagonHost just dropped their DC99 data center special—featuring Intel's latest SierraForest processors, triple-route CN2 GIA return paths, and surprisingly decent specs at $34.50 annually. Not the flashiest deal, but if you need reliable access without breaking the bank, this might be worth a look.

## What You're Actually Getting

So here's the thing about this BIGGERBOX promotion—it's not revolutionary, but it's honest work. One CPU core running Intel Xeon SierraForest (not the AMD EPYC from the old Minibox days), 1GB RAM, 20GB SSD storage, and 1TB monthly traffic on a 1Gbps port. The Los Angeles DC99 facility handles routing with CN2/4837/CMIN2 outbound and triple-network CN2 GIA inbound.

The catch? You need an invitation code to order. And the provider explicitly states network quality is "best effort, no guarantees"—which is refreshingly honest, actually. They're not promising the moon.

Payment options are straightforward: credit cards, PayPal, Alipay, and UnionPay all work.

## Current Invitation Codes

Ten fresh codes, first-come basis:

```

If one doesn't work, try the next. They burn fast.

## The BIGGERBOX-20-1024 Breakdown

**Specs:**
- 1x Intel Xeon SierraForest core
- 1GB RAM
- 20GB SSD storage
- 1Gbps bandwidth
- 1TB monthly transfer
- Los Angeles DC99 location
- Optimized China routes (best effort)

**Pricing:** $34.50/year with coupon code **BWHCGLUKKB**

For folks currently on the old Minibox plan wanting to upgrade, the provider asks you to wait until December 18th or later before submitting a ticket. Free backups and snapshots are included, and those snapshots support export/import—useful if you're the tinkering type.

Now, about those network routes. The outbound path uses CN2/4837/CMIN2, while return traffic gets the triple-network CN2 GIA treatment. In plain terms: your connection to China *should* be decent, but again, no promises from the provider. They're covering their bases here, which honestly makes sense given how unpredictable international routing can be.

👉 If you're weighing different options for China-optimized hosting, [BandwagonHost's transparent approach to network quality—no fake guarantees, just honest "best effort" service—makes them worth considering for projects where budget matters more than SLA perfection](https://bandwagonhost.com/aff.php?aff=79616).

## How This Compares to Minibox

The older MINIBOX-10-512 plan (which may or may not still be available) ran on AMD EPYC processors with triple-network CN2 routes—GIA return, GIA/CMIN2/CU outbound. That's the baseline if you want to compare apples to apples.

The DC99 special swaps the CPU architecture and bumps storage from 10GB to 20GB while maintaining similar network characteristics. Not a massive leap, but the Intel SierraForest chips are newer silicon.

## Bottom Line

This DC99 promotion sits in that practical middle ground—not the cheapest annual VPS you'll find, not the most premium either. The $34.50 price point makes sense if you specifically need China connectivity and want free snapshots without dealing with complex migration processes. The invitation code requirement keeps casual buyers out, which probably helps prevent the usual overselling issues budget hosts fall into. For small projects, development environments, or personal use cases where you value straightforward service over marketing fluff, [BandwagonHost's DC99 offering delivers exactly what it promises—nothing more, nothing less, which is refreshing in this market](https://bandwagonhost.com/aff.php?aff=79616).
